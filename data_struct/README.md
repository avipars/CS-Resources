## DSA 1 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Linked Lists, Trees, Queues, Heaps, Stacks, etc. 

The course used pseudo-code, but I made some of my own programs to test my understanding of these algos. and to do some fun stuff!

| Notation                        | Definition                                                                 | Relationship             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| f(n)\=o(g(n)) | f(n) grows slower than g(n) as n approaches infinity         | f(n)<g(n)   |
| f(n)\=ω(g(n)) | f(n) grows faster than g(n) as n approaches infinity         | f(n)\>g(n) |
| f(n)\=O(g(n)) | f(n) grows at most as fast as g(n) as n approaches infinity  | f(n)≤g(n)   |
| f(n)\=Ω(g(n)) | f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n) as n approaches infinity | f(n)≥g(n)   |
| f(n)\=Θ(g(n)) | f(n) grows at the same rate as g(n) as n approaches infinity | f(n)\=g(n) |
