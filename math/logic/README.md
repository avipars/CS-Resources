### Notes: 

- We studied sentential logic as part of the course, but it is often referred to as Propositional logic/calculus

- We also used a system called L arrow which exists in sentential logic (sometimes called language PC) 

- I advise reading the Rosen Discrete Math Book, in the first few hundred pages... it covers most of what the course does.

Python and programming aren't required for the course but its a good way to check your work!
and view my sample program for testing logic * [here](/math/logic/program.py)
using the SymPy library


we also studied graph theory in the end of the course... I will add some more info on that as well!
