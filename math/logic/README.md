Some digital systems content, sentential logic, predicate logic, graph theory 

Read: "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" by Kenneth H. Rosen (not required by the course)



# Notes: 

- We studied sentential logic as part of the course, but it is often referred to as Propositional logic/calculus

- We also used a system called L arrow which exists in sentential logic (sometimes called Language PC or System PC) 

- I advise reading the Rosen Discrete Math Book, in the first few hundred pages... it covers most of what the course does.

- This is not my exhaustive list of notes (& proofs), there are topics not covered in the course on this page, so do not use this as your main source of notes

## Logic 


### Sentential Logic Refresher

Here are some stuff worth knowing (on top of the basic gates/symbols)


  * a ‚Üë b = ¬¨(a ‚àß b) = nand

  * a ‚Üì b = ¬¨(a ‚à® b) = nor

  * F = constant false

  * T = constant true 

  * A ‚áí B

    - When A is true and B is false, the sentence gets the False truth value, otherwise it will always get the True truth value

    - Called If then, Implies, or Conditional

  * A ‚Üî B = A ‚äô B ‚â° (A ‚áí B) ‚àß (B ‚áí A)

      - if and only if = x-nor

  * A ‚äï B ‚â° (A ‚àß ¬¨B) ‚à® (¬¨A ‚àß B)

  * ‚àÄy - Universal quantifier - For all y

  * ‚àÉx - Existential quantifier - There exists x

###  Functional completeness

- Any functionally complete set of logical symbols (gates) can be used to create any other gate

- Functionally complete sets that are good to know for exams and homeworks, here is a non exhaustive list of some basic ones

- AND, OR, NOT : {‚àß, ‚à®, ¬¨}

- NAND : {‚Üë}

- NOR : {‚Üì}

- AND, NOT : {‚àß, ¬¨}

- OR, NOT : {‚à®, ¬¨}

- Additional ones:

  - IMP, NOT : {‚áí, ¬¨}

  - XOR, IMP : {‚äï, ‚áí}

  - AND, BIDIRECTIONAL, FALSE : {‚àß, ‚Üî, F}

  - OR, BIDIRECTIONAL, FALSE : {‚à®, ‚Üî, F}

IMP = Implication 

A formula is satisfiable if it is true under some assignment of values to its variables

A formula is valid if every assignment of values to variables make the formula true.

A sentence is a formula without free variables (AKA with only bound variables).

A set of sentences is consistent if and only if it's possible for all sentences in the set to be true at the same time (together).

### More graph properties:

- In the course, we usually substitute F = number of faces,  n = number of vertices, m = number of edges (important for formula sheet)

- Graph is bipartite if and only if all cycles have even length 

- K<sub>5</sub> - Complete graph with 5 vertices, not bipartite and not planar

![K5 graph](k5.png)

- K<sub>3,3</sub> - Non-planar graph that has 3 vertices on top, 3 on bottom that is bipartite and complete (sometimes split left and right)

![K3,3 graph](k3.png)

- Any complete graph (a graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex) with > 5 vertices is not planar: it is homeomorphic of K<sub>5</sub> or K<sub>3,3</sub>

- Any complete graph has a Hamilton cycle 

- A graph with m >= n-1 edges, n >= 3 vertices will have a cycle

- Regular graph = each vertex has the same degree (same number of edges touching it)

- A Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at adjacent vertices can be completed by adding one more edge to form a Hamiltonian cycle, and removing any edge from a Hamiltonian cycle produces a Hamiltonian path.

- Q<sub>n</sub> - graph of n-dimensional hypercube 

  * is bipartite

  * Always has 2<sup>n</sup> vertices, n2<sup>n-1</sup> edges

    - it is a regular graph, each vertex has degree of n

  * for even n, it will have a Euler cycle 

  * for graph with n > 1
  
    - has Hamiltonian cycle 
 
    - is planar (iff 1 < n <= 3)
  
  * Q1 is a line, Q2 is a square Q3 is a cube, higher dimensions are harder to visualize


#### Good to know 

Implication: A ‚áí B

  * A implies B (If A then B)

    - A ‚áí B is false when A is true and B is false, but otherwise it's true

Meta-Deduction: A ‚ä¢ B

  * A proves B

    - B can be proved using A as premise

  * ‚ä¢ A

    - A is a tautology (every premise can deduce A)

Meta-implication: A ‚ä® B

  * A entails B

    - B is true in every structure where A is true

    - In every model, it is not the case that A is true and B is false
