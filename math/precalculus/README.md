Make sure to focus on logarithm, polynomial, and exponential functions.  In addition, work on synthetic division and analytical geometry. Lastly, learn about sigma notation,  sequences/sums, and proof by induction. 


### Stuff to remember:


#### Trig: 

pi = 180 degrees

Soh Cah Toa

Sin = Opposite/Hypotenuse

Cos = Adjacent/Hypotenuse

Tan = Opposite/Adjacent (= sin/cos)

##### Reciprocals 

Csc = Hypotenuse/Opposite or 1/Sin

Sec = Hypotenuse/Adjacent or 1/Cos

Cot = Adjacent/Opposite (= cos/sin) or 1/Tan
