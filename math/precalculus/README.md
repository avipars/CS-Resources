Precalculus

[Formula Sheet](https://github.com/avipars/CS-Resources/files/8949180/Precalculus.Formula.Sheet.pdf)


Make sure to focus on logarithm, polynomial, and exponential functions.  In addition, work on synthetic division and analytical geometry. Lastly, learn about sigma notation,  sequences/sums, and proof by induction. 


### Stuff to remember:


### Trig: 

pi = 180 degrees

Soh Cah Toa

Sin = Opposite/Hypotenuse

Cos = Adjacent/Hypotenuse

Tan = Opposite/Adjacent (sin/cos)

#### Reciprocals

Csc = Hypotenuse/Opposite

Sec = Hypotenuse/Adjacent

Cot = Adjacent/Opposite (cos/sin)
