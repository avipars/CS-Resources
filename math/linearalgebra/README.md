Linear Algebra 

Matrix manipulations, lots of higher dimensional thinking, not proof based. I found this course more intuitive than Calculus. Linear dependence, vectors, matrices, determinants, etc. 


[Matrices](https://github.com/avipars/CS-Resources/blob/main/math/linearalgebra/Matrices.xlsx)


### Common Symbols in LA:

ℝ = All real numbers (integers, rational, irrational)

ℝ<sup>n</sup> = n denotes the dimension we are in. 

ℝ<sup>2</sup> is the cartesian plane (x,y). 

ℝ<sup>3</sup> is in 3 dimensional space (x,y,z). 


#### Let A denote a matrix: 

"|" A "|"  or det(A) = The determinant of Matrix A (ignore the quotes)

"| A |" 

*I* = The identity matrix 

E = The elementary matrix

E<sub>ij</sub> = i denotes the # of rows in the matrix, and j denotes the # of columns/

M<sub>mxn</sub> = All matricies with m rows and n columns

A<sup>-1</sup> = The inverse matrix of A

A<sup>T</sup> = The transpose matrix of A

sp(A) = The span of A (set of all linear combinations of the vectors/matrices)

dim(A) = The dimension of A

rank(A) = The rank of A (dimension of row space)

##### Let A,B denote 2 vectors

"|" "|"  A "|" "|"  = The norm of A (ignore the quotes)

A X B  = The cross product of A and B (only defined in the 3rd Dimension)

A * B or A . B = The dot product (inner product) of A and B (scalar)

A ⊂ B  = A is a subset of B
