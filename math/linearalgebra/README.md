Linear Algebra 

Matrix manipulations, lots of higher dimensional thinking, not proof based. I found this course more intuitive than Calculus. Linear dependence, vectors, matrices, determinants, etc. 


[Matrices](https://github.com/avipars/CS-Resources/blob/main/math/linearalgebra/Matrices.xlsx)


### Common Symbols in LA:

ℝ = All real numbers (integers, rational, irrational)

ℝ<sub>n</sub> = n denotes the dimension we are in. 

ℝ<sub>2</sub> is the cartesian plane (x,y). 

ℝ<sub>3</sub> is in 3 dimensional space (x,y,z). 


#### Let A denote a matrix: 

|A| or det(A) = The determinant of Matrix A 

*I* = The identity matrix 

E = The elementary matrix

E<sub>ij</sub> = i denotes the # of rows in the matrix, and j denotes the # of columns/

M<sub>mxn</sub> = All matricies with m rows and n columns

A<sup>-1</sup> = The inverse matrix of A

A<sup>T</sup> = The transpose matrix of A

sp(A) = The span of A

dim(A) = The dimension of A

rank(A) = The rank of A

##### Let A,B denote 2 vectors

|| A || = The norm of A

A X B  = The cross product of A and B (only defined in the 3rd Dimension)

A * B or A . B = The dot product of A and B (scalar)

A ⊂ B  = A is a subset of B
