Linear Algebra:

Matrix manipulations, lots of higher dimensional thinking, not proof based. I found this course more intuitive than Calculus. Linear dependence, vectors, matrices, determinants, etc. 


[Matrices](https://github.com/avipars/CS-Resources/blob/main/math/linearalgebra/Matrices.xlsx)


### Common Symbols in LA:

ℝ = All real numbers (integers, rational, irrational)

ℝ<sup>n</sup> = n denotes the dimension we are in

ℝ<sup>2</sup> is the cartesian plane (x,y) aka 2D space 

ℝ<sup>3</sup> is in 3 dimensional space (x,y,z) 


#### Let A denote a matrix: 

\| A \|   or det(A) = The determinant of Matrix A 

I = The identity matrix 

E = The elementary matrix

E<sub>ij</sub> = i denotes the # of rows in the matrix, and j denotes the # of columns

M<sub>mxn</sub> = All matricies with m rows and n columns

A<sup>-1</sup> = The inverse matrix of A

A<sup>T</sup> = The transpose matrix of A

sp(A) or span(A) = The span of A (set of all linear combinations of the vectors/matrices)

dim(A) = The dimension of A

col(A) = Column space of A (span of its column vectors)

row(A) = Row space of A (span of its column vectors)

rank(A) = The rank of A (dimension of row space)

adj(A) = Adjugate matrix (transpose of cofactor matrix)

##### Let A,B denote 2 vectors

→
A =  A is a vector

\|\| A \|\|  = The norm of A 

A X B  = The cross product of A and B (only defined in the 3rd Dimension)

A * B or A . B = The dot product (inner product) of A and B (scalar)

A ⊂ B  = A is a subset of B
