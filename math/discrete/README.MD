#### Set theory

- A, B are both sets such that:

    * A ∪ B = {x ∈ A or x ∈ B or both}

    * A ∩ B = {x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

    * A ⊕ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)

    * A - B = A ∩ Bᶜ = {x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

    - Demorgan's laws:

        * (A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ

        * (A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ

    - Associativity: 

        * A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ B ∪ C

    - Distributivity;

        * A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)

        * A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

- Subsets: 

    * A ⊆ A ∪ B = B ∪ A

    * B ⊆ A ∪ B

    * If A ⊆ B, then A ∪ B = B

    * A ∩ B ⊆ A ⊆ A ∪ B

    * B ∩ A ⊆ B ⊆ A ∪ B

- Universal Set = U:

    for any finite set A

    * `U = { x ∈ U | x ∉ A }`

    * Aᶜ = U - A

    * (Aᶜ)ᶜ = A

    * Uᶜ = ∅

    * ∅ᶜ = U
 
 - Bidirectional inclusion:

    * To prove A = B, need to prove both B ⊆ A and A ⊆ B

- Power-set:

 * The power set of A is denoted as P(A) or 2^A

 * A ∈ P(A), ∅ ∈ P(A)

 * `If |A| = n, then |P(A)|` = 2<sup>n</sup>

 * `|P(A)|` = 2<sup>|A|</sup>

 * If A = ∅, then P(A) = {∅}

 * If A = {1,2}, then P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}

 * `|A| < |P(A)|`
 
 * P(A) ∩ P(B) = P(A ∩ B)

    - Proof
        * Forward Inclusion:
            Let 𝑋 be an arbitrary element in 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵). By definition of intersection, 𝑋 belongs to both 𝑃(𝐴) and 𝑃(𝐵). This implies 𝑋 is a subset of both 𝐴 and 𝐵. Consequently, 𝑋 is also a subset of their intersection, 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵. Thus, 𝑋 is an element of 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵). Therefore, 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵) ⊆ 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵).

        * Reverse Inclusion:
            Let 𝑌 be an arbitrary element in 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵). By definition, 𝑌 is a subset of 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵, hence a subset of both 𝐴 and 𝐵. Consequently, 𝑌 belongs to both 𝑃(𝐴) and 𝑃(𝐵). Thus, 𝑌 is an element of 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵). Therefore, 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ⊆ 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵).

        * Conclusion:
            Combining both directions of inclusion, we've demonstrated that 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵) ⊆ 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) and 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ⊆ 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵), implying 𝑃(𝐴) ∩ 𝑃(𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵). Thus, the equality holds.

    
 * P(A) ∪ P(B) ≠ P(A ∪ B)

    - Example of why these aren't equal: 
        * A = {1}, B = {2}, A ∪ B = {1,2} => P(A ∪ B) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}

        * P(A) = {∅, {1}}, P(B) = {∅, {2}} => P(A) ∪ P(B) = {∅, {1}, {2}}

- Cartesian product:

 * `A × B = { (a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B }`

    - an unordered set of sets of ordered pairs where a is in A, b is in B
    
    - if A = {1,2}, B = {2,3}, then A × B = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)}

 * A × B ≠ B × A (unless A = B)

 * A ∩ (A × B) = ∅

 * `|A × B| = |A| × |B|`

 - Distribution:

    * A × (B ∪ C) = (A × B) ∪ (A × C)

    * A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C)

#### Relations

- ARB = (a,b) ∈ R

- Identity: Ia = (a,a) 

    * Ex: {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3), ... } 

- Relation on set itself: R ⊆ A × A

    * ARA is another way to write it too. 

- Empty relation when R = ∅

    * implies that the relation R is empty, meaning it does not hold between any two pairs. It's essentially a relation with no elements.

- Complete relation when R = A × B

    * implies that the relation R contains all possible pairs that can be formed by taking one element from set A and one element from set B. It's a relation where every element of A is related to every element of B.

- Inverse relation is R⁻¹ = `{ (b, a) | (a, b) ∈ R }`

    * R consists of all pairs in R but with their elements reversed. If (a,b) is in R, then (b,a) is in R⁻¹

- Composition of relations:

    * R ∘ S = `{ (a, c) | ∃ b : (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ S }`

    * Set of pairs (a,c) such that exists an element b for which both (a,b) is in R and (b,c) is in S

    * R ∘ R = R<sup>2</sup> is a relation composed with itself
    
    * (R ∘ S) ∘ T = R ∘ (S ∘ T) i.e it is associative (but not communitive)

    * Ia ∘ R = R 
    
- Important relations:

    1. **Reflexive:**
    - Shorthand: Ia ⊆ R
    - Meaning: Every element is related to itself. 
        - for all a ∈ A, aRa holds
        -  \( R ⊆ \{(a, a) \| a ∈ A\} \)

    2. **Transitive:**
    - Shorthand: \( R ∘ R = R<sup>2</sup   ⊆ R \)
    - Meaning: If \( (a, b) ∈ R \) and \( (b, c) ∈ R \), then \( (a, c) ∈ R \).
        - (aRb and bRc) -> aRc

    3. **Symmetric:**
    - Shorthand: \( R = R⁻¹ \)
    - Meaning: If \( (a, b) ∈ R \), then \( (b, a) ∈ R \).
        - When aRb <=> bRa

    4. **Antisymmetric:**
    - Shorthand: \( R ∩ R⁻¹ ⊆ \{(a, a) \| a ∈ A\} \)
    - Meaning: If \( (a, b) ∈ R \) and \( (b, a) ∈ R \), then \( a = b \).
        - (aRb and bRa) -> (a = b)
    - This does not mean not-symmetric 

- Equivalence relation

    -  is one where 1,2,3 all hold

- Order relation 
  
    - Partial order IFF 1,2,4 all hold
        * clear hasse diagram can be drawn 
            - items for which the relation doesn't hold will be drawn but not connected to the others in the diagram
    
    - Total/Linear order:
        * Partial order holds
        * Totality: For any \( a, b ∈ A \), either \( (a, b) ∈ R \) or \( (b, a) ∈ R \).
         - In other words: For any two distinct elements a and b, either a is related to b (a ≤ b), or b is related to a (b ≤ a).
        * hasse diagram would be a straight line (all elements relate to one another in this set)

    - Terms:
        * Minimal: An element a is minimal if there is no b such that b precedes a.
            -  Elements with nothing less than them (no predacessors)
        * Minimum: An element a is a minimum if for all b, a precedes b.
            -  Element that is less than everything else (either a set has 1 minimum or no minimum element)
        * Maximal: An element a is maximal if there is no b such that a precedes b.
            - follows from minimal
        * Maximum: An element a is a maximum if for all b, b precedes a.
            - follows from minimum
