Part A: (Multiple choice, choose 6 out of 7)

Q1 A

Q2 D

I typed out the code for the multiple choice questions as well, and they will be in the same directory. 
Note that the code is not necessarily one-to-one with the final exam, the changes that I may have made are very minor and easy to revert. Feel free to fork this or copy the code, run it, and make changes!
