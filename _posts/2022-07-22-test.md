### Welcome

Welcome to my CS Resources website, unlike my blog or [regular website...](https://www.aviparshan.com)
Here, the primary focus and goal is to provide rleevant information for many CS courses at a high level! 
If the course has some programmign involved, I will try to add and share my code. 

I am using a jekyll theme with some customizations hosted on a public repo using github pages. 
You can see the code here: https://github.com/avipars/CS-Resources
